# Movie-Climax dataset
Movie-Climax is a Polish dataset for text classification. It's purpose is to predict whether a piece of subtitles comes from the first 25% of the movie dialogue (not from the climax, labeled as 0) or from the last 25% (climax, labeled as 1)

It has 2473 examples from 19 movies, mostly action-filled and not overly unconventional. The data comes from napiprojekt .srt subtitle files

The text of each example is aggregated from 5 dialogue units to provide more context

Warning! The dataset is unshuffled. It is also a very hard task for a human - it would be interesting if machine could perform well
